**1. Project Setup & Core Ticket Functionality (Milestone 1)**

*   - [x] **Setup Project with `create-t3-app`**: Initialize your Next.js application with the T3 stack.
    *   Choose your preferred database (PlanetScale, Prisma, and NextAuth are standard with T3).
    *   Configure tRPC for backend communication.
    *   Set up Tailwind CSS (already included with shadcn/ui, but ensure it's working).
*   - [x] **Database Schema Design**: Plan your database schema for tickets, users, and any related data.
    *   Consider fields like `title`, `description`, `status`, `priority`, `category`, `assigned user`, `timestamps`, etc.
    *   Define relationships between tables (e.g., user-ticket, ticket-status).
*   - [x] **Backend tRPC API for Tickets (CRUD Operations)**: Implement tRPC endpoints for basic ticket operations.
    *   `createTicket`: Endpoint to create new tickets.
    *   `getTickets`: Endpoint to fetch a list of tickets (consider pagination and filtering later).
    *   `getTicketById`: Endpoint to fetch a single ticket by ID.
    *   `updateTicket`: Endpoint to update ticket details.
    *   `deleteTicket`: Endpoint to delete tickets.
*   - [x] **Basic Ticket Model & Prisma Integration**: Define your Prisma schema and models to interact with the database for ticket data.
*   - [x] **Initial Frontend Ticket Pages (View & Create)**: Create basic React components for:
    *   **Ticket List Page**: Display a list of tickets (initially just displaying basic data).
    *   **Create Ticket Page**: Form to create new tickets, connected to the `createTicket` tRPC endpoint.
    *   **Ticket Detail Page**: Display details of a single ticket fetched using `getTicketById`.
*   - [x] **Basic Styling with Shadcn/ui**: Style the initial components using components from shadcn/ui to get a clean and consistent look.

**2. User Authentication & Authorization (Milestone 2)**

*   - [x] **Implement User Authentication with NextAuth.js**: Set up user authentication to manage users who can access and interact with the ticket system.
    *   Choose an authentication provider (e.g., Credentials, Google, GitHub).
    *   Define user roles (e.g., admin, agent, user) if necessary for authorization.
*   - [x] **User Model & Prisma Integration**: Extend your Prisma schema and models to include user data.
*   - [x] **Protected Routes**: Implement protected routes to ensure only authenticated users can access certain pages (like ticket creation, viewing, etc.).
*   - [ ] **Basic User Management (Admin Panel - Optional for MVP)**:  If needed for your application, create a basic admin panel to manage users.
*   - [ ] **Authorization Logic**: Implement authorization logic to control what users can do based on roles or permissions (e.g., who can create tickets, who can update status, who can assign tickets).

**3. Advanced Ticket Features & Refinement (Milestone 3)**

*   - [ ] **Ticket Status & Priority Management**: Implement features to manage ticket statuses (Open, In Progress, Resolved, Closed, etc.) and priorities (High, Medium, Low).
    *   Database schema updates for status and priority.
    *   Frontend components to set and display status and priority.
    *   Backend logic to handle status and priority updates.
*   - [ ] **Ticket Assignment**: Implement functionality to assign tickets to users/agents.
    *   Database schema updates to link tickets to assigned users.
    *   Frontend components for assigning tickets.
    *   Backend logic for ticket assignment.
*   - [ ] **Filtering, Sorting, and Searching**: Implement features to filter, sort, and search tickets in the ticket list page.
    *   Backend logic to handle filtering, sorting, and searching in the `getTickets` endpoint.
    *   Frontend components for filter and search inputs.
*   - [ ] **Comments/Notes on Tickets**: Allow users to add comments or notes to tickets for better communication and context.
    *   Database schema for comments/notes (linked to tickets and users).
    *   Frontend components to display and add comments.
    *   Backend tRPC endpoints to manage comments.

**4. Polish & Additional Features (Milestone 4 - Optional/Extendable)**

*   - [ ] **Notifications (Optional)**: Implement email or in-app notifications for ticket updates, assignments, etc.
*   - [ ] **Rich Text Editor for Ticket Descriptions & Comments (Optional)**: Integrate a rich text editor for better formatting in ticket descriptions and comments.
*   - [ ] **File Attachments (Optional)**: Allow users to attach files to tickets.
*   - [ ] **Reporting & Analytics (Optional)**:  Implement basic reporting or analytics on ticket data (e.g., ticket resolution time, ticket volume over time).
*   - [ ] **Testing (Unit & Integration Tests)**:  Write tests for your frontend components and backend tRPC endpoints to ensure stability and prevent regressions.
*   - [ ] **Deployment**: Deploy your application to a hosting platform (Vercel is a great choice for Next.js).
